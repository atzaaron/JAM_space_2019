# JAM_space_2019

## Context

The JAM_space_2019 project is a video game created in 48 hours during an Epitech Game Jam whose the theme was "space".

I used Unity2d for this project.

## Description

This game is named "The Escaping Rocket". 
A mechanic created a rocket with powerful artificial intelligence. As soon as he finished it, it was able to move around and speak. Its purpose is to escape from the building in which it was created.
