# JAM_space_2019

You can just clone the repo and start "Epitech Jam 2020.exe". 

## Context

The JAM_space_2019 project is a video game created in 48 hours during an Epitech Game Jam whose the theme was "space".

I used Unity2d for this project.

## Description

This game is named "The Escaping Rocket". 

A mechanic created a rocket with powerful artificial intelligence. As soon as he finished it, it was able to move around and speak. Its purpose is to escape from the building in which it was created.

## How to play

Keyboard arrows -> move the rocketship

Space -> fly

Escape -> pause the game
